# Mid_project

Name of the project : WATER TAKINGS, CONSUMPTION AND POLLUTIONS IN FRANCE (2010-2019)


1. Questions :
   
- Who takes water ?
- Who consumes the most water and why ?
- What impact does their consumption have on nature?
- What area in France has the greatest water consumption ?
- What pollutes water ?


2. Link to the 5 original datasets :

3. Code :
   
I had a lot of cleaning to make on the 5 dataframes:
- rename columns (with a function)
- remove columns (with a function)
- change value types
- replace comas by dots
Then I tried to concatanate dataframes, but this was not relevant for the analysis, so I stopped and came back to 5 dataframes.


4. Presentation in Tableau :

I decided to build the presentation in Tableau because I wanted to show maps of basins in France.
